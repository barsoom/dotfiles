Recommended dotfiles for new developers.

The aliases, settings and such that we try to agree on.

For now, no scripts or anything to set them up. Just a dump of settings. We assume developers want to adapt existing dotfiles towards this but not use this repo exactly.

## TODO

* Common githooks?
* Agree on more aliases/workflows, especially git
